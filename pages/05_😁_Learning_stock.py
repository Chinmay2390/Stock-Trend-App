st.write("\tA stock market is a marketplace where buyers and sellers meet to trade i.e. buy and sell shares of publicly listed companies. A stock market is fondly known as a share market, equity market or share bazaar.\n\nIn simple terms, if Ram wants to sell 10 shares of Reliance Industries at Rs 1990/ share, he will place a sell order on the stock exchange. The stock exchange will then find a buyer who wants to buy 10 shares of Reliance Industries at Rs 1990/ share. So, the stock market is a virtual market where the buyers and sellers meet to trade shares. ")

VAP and Equivolume charts add volume data to the chart analysis. Finally, Market Profile and Point and Figure charts remove the timeline X-axis from chart analysis.\n\nThe Line Chart is the simplest, depicting only the closing price. The High Low Close Chart shows the price high low & close. As we move to OHLC, Japanese Candlestick, and Point & Figure Charts, a new world of understanding supply and demand is unleashed.")
